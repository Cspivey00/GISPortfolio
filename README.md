This is my Advanced GIS Portfolio!

# About Me: 

I am a second-year MSPPM. I studied Political Science at Virginia Wesleyan University in Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Virginia. I attended Graduate school directly after my completing my undergraduate degree, however I was also a field organizer on two local state races in Virginia and a field organizer for Clinton's Preisdential Campaign at Ohio State University. In between my first and second year at Carnegie Mellon, I was a Boren Fellow in Maputo, Mozambique and also spent two months in Porto, Portugal to study portuguese. 

## What I Hope to Learn 

I am taking this class because I am interested in continue learning strong fundamentals for GIS Analysis and I think this class will also provide strong project management skills for geospatial analysis. I think GIS is particularly interesting because there are certain connections that cannot be demonstrated or analyzed otherwise. 

In this class I would like to focus on specific skillsets such as developing network analysis, refreshing my skills for creating base layer maps that can quickly be applied to other projects, creating routing systems, applying open source data to maps, and furthering my understanding of creating processes that can be applied to several different projects. Finally, I am interested in learning about free software that can be used for organizations that may not want to purchase ESRI. 

I am particularly interested to see how our class projects on COVID19 turn out and hope that they contribute to existing research.
